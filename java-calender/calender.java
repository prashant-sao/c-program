/*  in this we are using zeller's rule that states 
F=k+ [(13*m-1)/5] +D+ [D/4] +[C/4]-2*C where

k is  the day of the month.
m is the month number.
D is the last two digits of the year.
C is the first two digits of the year. 

The catch in this formula is that the month are started from march whose index is 1 and 
than go on till feb of next year whose index is 12, so for january and february we will find 
day of the corresponding date by subtracting 1 from year i.e we will calculate it for previous
year */
